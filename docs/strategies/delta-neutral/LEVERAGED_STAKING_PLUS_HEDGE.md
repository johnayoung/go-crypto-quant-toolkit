# Complete Leveraged Staking + Hedge Automation Process

## Strategy Overview
**Objective**: Maximize staking yields through recursive leverage while maintaining delta neutrality via perpetual shorts.
**Target Return**: 12-18% APY on stablecoin capital
**Risk Profile**: Medium (liquidation managed, delta hedged)

## Phase 1: Pre-Position Analysis (Every 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Data Collection & Monitoring
```
1.1 Fetch current market data
    - ETH price from multiple oracles
      * Chainlink primary feed
      * Binance/Coinbase backup
      * Calculate 1-minute TWAP
    - stETH/ETH ratio monitoring
      * Target: 0.995-1.005
      * Alert if deviation >0.5%
    - wstETH/stETH ratio (constant 1.15+)

1.2 Scan liquid staking yields
    Primary:
    - Lido stETH: Current APR (typically 3-4%)
    - Rocket Pool rETH: Current APR
    - Frax sfrxETH: Current APR
    - Coinbase cbETH: Current APR
    
    Alternative:
    - Binance BETH: Yield + liquidity
    - Swell swETH: Yield + incentives
    - StakeWise osETH: Yield structure

1.3 Monitor lending market conditions
    Ethereum Mainnet:
    - Aave V3: stETH supply/borrow rates
    - Aave V3: wstETH supply/borrow rates
    - Aave V3: ETH borrow rate
    - Spark: DAI rates for stETH collateral
    - Morpho: Optimized Aave markets
    
    Layer 2s:
    - Arbitrum Aave: wstETH markets
    - Optimism Aave: wstETH markets
    - Base: Limited stETH markets

1.4 Calculate recursive leverage parameters
    For each lending market:
    - Maximum LTV (usually 80-85% for stETH)
    - Liquidation threshold (typically 82.5%)
    - Safe operating LTV (70% recommended)
    - Liquidation penalty (5-10%)
    - Supply cap remaining
    - E-mode availability (90% LTV possible)

1.5 Monitor perpetual funding rates
    CEX (via aggregators):
    - Binance ETH-USDT perps
    - Coinbase International ETH-USD
    - OKX ETH-USDT perps
    - Bybit ETH-USDT/USD perps
    
    DEX on-chain:
    - GMX V2 (Arbitrum): ETH-USD
    - Vertex Protocol: ETH-USDC
    - Hyperliquid: ETH-USD
    - Synthetix V3 Perps
    - Gains Network: ETH/USD
    - MUX Protocol: Cross-chain perps

1.6 Gas optimization analysis
    - Current mainnet gas (target <30 gwei)
    - L2 costs for perpetual management
    - Estimate full position build cost
    - Rebalancing transaction costs
    - Claim & compound costs
```

### Step 2: Yield Calculation & Opportunity Matrix
```
2.1 Calculate base staking yields
    Lido stETH example:
    - Base staking APR: 3.5%
    - Less Lido fee (10%): 3.15% net
    - Auto-compounding via rebasing
    
2.2 Calculate leveraged returns
    Starting with 1000 ETH worth $2M:
    
    Leverage buildup (70% LTV):
    - Round 1: 1000 stETH → borrow 700 ETH
    - Round 2: 700 stETH → borrow 490 ETH  
    - Round 3: 490 stETH → borrow 343 ETH
    - Round 4: 343 stETH → borrow 240 ETH
    - Round 5: 240 stETH → borrow 168 ETH
    - Round 6: 168 stETH → borrow 118 ETH
    - Round 7: 118 stETH → borrow 82 ETH
    - Round 8: 82 stETH → borrow 57 ETH
    - Round 9: 57 stETH → borrow 40 ETH
    - Round 10: 40 stETH → borrow 28 ETH
    
    Final position:
    - Total stETH: ~3,266 stETH
    - Total borrowed: ~2,266 ETH
    - Leverage ratio: 3.266x
    
2.3 Calculate net APY
    Revenue:
    + Staking on 3,266 stETH: 3.5% = 114.31 ETH/year
    + Supply APY on Aave: 0.1% = 3.27 ETH/year
    
    Costs:
    - Borrow APY (2.5%): 2,266 * 0.025 = -56.65 ETH/year
    - Perpetual funding (avg -0.01% daily): +26.2 ETH/year
    
    Net return: 87.13 ETH/year on 1000 ETH = 8.71% APY
    
2.4 Risk-adjusted opportunity ranking
    Score = (Net APY * Protocol Safety * Liquidity Score) / Risk Factor
    
    Factors:
    - Protocol TVL (>$1B = 1.0, <$100M = 0.5)
    - Liquidity depth (can exit $10M = 1.0)
    - Historical uptime (>1 year clean = 1.0)
    - Smart contract audits (3+ audits = 1.0)
```

## Phase 2: Position Building (One-Time Setup)

### Step 3: Initial Liquid Staking
```
3.1 Pre-stake validation
    Check before staking 1000 ETH:
    - Lido staking queue (usually instant)
    - Current stETH supply (under limit?)
    - Withdrawal queue status
    - Oracle health status
    - Beacon chain finality

3.2 Execute staking transaction
    Via FordeFi custody:
    
    Option A - Direct Lido stake:
    a. Call Lido.submit(referral) with 1000 ETH
    b. Receive 1000 stETH immediately
    c. Verify balance via balanceOf()
    d. Check rebasing is active
    
    Option B - DEX swap:
    a. Check Curve stETH/ETH pool
    b. If discount >0.5%, swap instead
    c. Get bonus stETH from discount
    d. Save gas vs direct stake

3.3 Convert to wstETH (recommended)
    Why: wstETH doesn't rebase, better for DeFi
    
    a. Approve stETH to wstETH contract
    b. Call wrap(1000e18)
    c. Receive ~870 wstETH (rate ~1.15)
    d. Verify wstETH balance

3.4 Bridge preparation (if using L2)
    For Arbitrum deployment:
    a. Use official Arbitrum bridge
    b. Or use Across/Stargate for speed
    c. Wait for confirmations (7 days native)
    d. Verify wstETH on L2
```

### Step 4: Recursive Leverage Loop
```
4.1 Enable E-mode (if available)
    Aave V3 E-mode for ETH correlated assets:
    - Increases LTV to 90%
    - Lowers liquidation threshold to 93%
    - Only ETH, wstETH, wETH allowed
    
    Execute:
    a. Call pool.setUserEMode(1)
    b. Verify E-mode active
    c. Check new parameters

4.2 First leverage round
    Starting with 1000 wstETH:
    
    a. Approve wstETH to Aave
    b. Supply: pool.supply(wstETH, 1000e18, user, 0)
    c. Verify awstETH received
    d. Enable as collateral
    e. Check borrowing power: ~$1.4M (at 70% LTV)
    
    f. Borrow ETH: pool.borrow(WETH, 700e18, 2, 0, user)
    g. Verify 700 WETH received
    h. Check health factor: Should be ~1.43

4.3 Recursive loop automation
    For rounds 2-10:
    
    Process flow:
    - Stake each borrowed ETH amount to receive stETH
    - Wrap stETH to wstETH (ratio ~1.15)
    - Supply wstETH to Aave as collateral
    - Calculate next borrow at 70% LTV
    - Continue if borrow amount >10 ETH
    - Stop recursion when amount too small
    - Each round adds to total leverage
    - Track health factor after each round

4.4 Position verification after each round
    Critical checks:
    - Health factor >1.35 (safety buffer)
    - Total borrowed < target (2,266 ETH)
    - Supply cap not exceeded
    - Gas spent < $500 per round

4.5 Final position state
    After 10 rounds:
    - Total wstETH supplied: ~2,840
    - Total ETH borrowed: 2,266
    - Health factor: 1.37
    - Liquidation price: $1,180 (41% drop)
    - Annual staking yield: 114 ETH
```

### Step 5: Delta Hedge Implementation
```
5.1 Calculate exact hedge requirement
    Net exposure analysis:
    - Long: 3,266 ETH worth of stETH
    - Short (debt): -2,266 ETH
    - Net long: 1,000 ETH
    - Required perp short: 2,266 ETH (match debt)
    
    Why 2,266 not 1,000?
    - We keep 1000 ETH exposure (original capital)
    - Hedge the leveraged portion only

5.2 Distribute across venues
    Split for optimal funding and risk:
    
    40% on GMX V2 (900 ETH):
    - Best funding rates usually
    - High liquidity
    - On-chain transparency
    
    30% on Hyperliquid (680 ETH):
    - Cross-margin efficiency
    - Low fees
    - Good funding
    
    30% on Coinbase Intl (686 ETH):
    - CEX reliability
    - Deep liquidity
    - Prime broker access

5.3 Execute GMX V2 short
    Via FordeFi on Arbitrum:
    
    a. Bridge USDC for collateral (180k USDC for 900 ETH short)
    b. Approve USDC to GMX router
    c. Create position with parameters:
       - Market: ETH/USD
       - Collateral: 180,000 USDC
       - Size: -900 ETH (short)
       - Acceptable price: Current * 1.01
       - Position type: Short
    d. Call router.createPosition with parameters
    e. Verify position opened successfully
    f. Check liquidation price: >$2,400 (20% buffer)

5.4 Execute Hyperliquid short
    a. Transfer 136k USDC to Hyperliquid L1
    b. Use API/UI to open position:
       - Collateral: 136k USDC
       - Size: 680 ETH short
       - Leverage: 10x
       - Mode: Cross-margin
    c. Set liquidation alerts

5.5 Execute Coinbase International short
    Via Prime Broker API:
    
    a. Ensure USDC collateral in account
    b. Place perpetual short order:
       - Product: ETH-USD-PERP
       - Side: Sell
       - Size: 686 ETH
       - Type: Market order
    c. Execute order through API
    d. Verify fill confirmation
    e. Check margin requirements met
```

## Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring (Every 30 Seconds)

### Step 6: Health & Safety Monitoring
```
6.1 Lending health tracking
    Query every 30 seconds:
    
    Monitor critical metrics:
    - Total collateral value in USD
    - Total debt value in USD
    - Available borrowing capacity
    - Current loan-to-value ratio
    - Liquidation threshold
    - Health factor calculation
    
    Alert thresholds:
    - Health factor <1.3: Send critical alert
    - Health factor <1.2: Initiate auto-deleverage
    - Health factor <1.1: Emergency liquidation mode
    
    Response actions:
    - Calculate required repayment amount
    - Identify least profitable positions
    - Execute deleveraging sequence
    - Verify new health factor >1.35

6.2 stETH/ETH peg monitoring
    Critical for liquidation safety:
    
    - Normal range: 0.995-1.005
    - Warning at: <0.99 or >1.01
    - Emergency at: <0.98
    
    If depeg >2%:
    - Close perpetual hedges
    - Deleverage 50%
    - Wait for peg restoration

6.3 Perpetual position monitoring
    For each venue:
    
    GMX checks:
    - Position size still -900 ETH
    - Margin ratio >10%
    - Liquidation price distance
    - Funding rate direction
    
    If any position liquidated:
    - Immediately replace hedge
    - Use backup venue
    - Never stay unhedged

6.4 Correlation monitoring
    Track correlation breaks:
    
    - stETH/ETH spread
    - Funding vs borrow rate spread
    - Perpetual basis vs spot
    
    If correlation breaks >1%:
    - Investigate cause
    - Prepare to unwind if >2%
```

### Step 7: P&L Tracking & Analytics
```
7.1 Real-time P&L calculation
    Revenue streams (per day at 3,266 stETH position):
    
    Income:
    + stETH staking (3.5% on 3,266): 0.313 ETH/day
    + Negative funding earned: 0.072 ETH/day
    + Aave supply incentives: 0.009 ETH/day
    = Gross revenue: 0.394 ETH/day ($788)
    
    Costs:
    - ETH borrow (2.5% on 2,266): -0.155 ETH/day
    - Gas (monitoring + rebalance): -0.005 ETH/day
    - Execution slippage: -0.002 ETH/day
    = Total costs: -0.162 ETH/day ($324)
    
    Net profit: 0.232 ETH/day ($464)
    Effective APY: 8.47% on ETH, 23.2% on initial capital

7.2 Risk metrics tracking
    - Current leverage: 3.266x
    - Health factor: 1.37
    - Distance to liquidation: 41%
    - Max drawdown (30d): -3.2%
    - Sharpe ratio: 1.45
    - Funding rate average: -0.01%

7.3 Capital efficiency metrics
    - Capital deployed: $2M (1000 ETH)
    - Total position value: $6.53M
    - Earning on: $6.53M of stETH
    - Net USD return: $169,360/year
```

## Phase 4: Dynamic Rebalancing (Every 15 Minutes)

### Step 8: Rebalancing Triggers
```
8.1 Leverage ratio management
    Target leverage: 3.0-3.5x
    
    If leverage >3.5x (ETH price dropped):
    - Repay 10% of debt
    - Or add more collateral
    
    If leverage <3.0x (ETH price rose):
    - Borrow more and restake
    - Increase position to target

8.2 Health factor management
    Maintain 1.35-1.50 range:
    
    If health <1.35:
    - Immediate: Repay 100 ETH debt
    - Use flashloan if needed
    - Reduce leverage by one round
    
    If health >1.50:
    - Opportunity to add leverage
    - Only if funding remains negative

8.3 Funding rate optimization
    Monitor funding every hour:
    
    If funding >0.015% for 8 hours:
    - Close most expensive venue first
    - Rotate to negative funding venue
    - Consider reducing hedge 10%
    
    If funding <-0.03% (very negative):
    - Opportunity to increase hedge
    - Add 10% more short exposure

8.4 stETH/ETH ratio response
    If ratio <0.995:
    - Reduce leverage by 20%
    - Increase monitoring frequency
    - Prepare full unwind orders
    
    If ratio >1.005:
    - Opportunity for arbitrage
    - Can increase position size
```

### Step 9: Rebalancing Execution
```
9.1 Deleveraging procedure
    When reducing position by one round:
    
    a. Close 168 ETH of perpetual shorts
    b. Withdraw 145 wstETH from Aave
    c. Unwrap to 168 stETH
    d. Swap stETH for ETH on Curve
    e. Repay 168 ETH debt
    f. Verify new health factor >1.4

9.2 Re-leveraging procedure
    When adding leverage:
    
    a. Borrow additional 100 ETH
    b. Stake to receive 100 stETH
    c. Wrap to 87 wstETH
    d. Supply to Aave
    e. Open 100 ETH perpetual short
    f. Verify delta neutrality maintained

9.3 Emergency unwind procedure
    If critical event (depeg, hack risk):
    
    Priority order:
    1. Close all perpetual shorts FIRST
    2. Flashloan to repay all debt
    3. Withdraw all collateral
    4. Repay flashloan with collateral
    5. Convert stETH to ETH if possible
    6. Exit completely in <5 minutes

9.4 Compound reinvestment
    Weekly with accumulated rewards:
    
    If accumulated >1 ETH:
    - Add to leverage position
    - Maintain same leverage ratio
    - Increase perpetual hedge
    - Log compounding event
```

## Phase 5: Yield Optimization

### Step 10: Rewards & Incentives
```
10.1 Identify all reward sources
    Active incentives:
    - Aave merit rewards (if active)
    - Arbitrum ARB incentives
    - LDO rewards (if staking directly)
    - GMX rewards (esGMX + ETH)
    - Trading fee rebates

10.2 Optimal claiming schedule
    Daily claims:
    - GMX rewards (compound esGMX)
    - Trading rebates
    
    Weekly claims:
    - ARB rewards
    - Aave incentives
    
    Monthly:
    - Analyze and sell accumulated tokens
    - Reinvest into position

10.3 Tax optimization
    Track for reporting:
    - Staking rewards (income)
    - Perpetual P&L (capital gains)
    - DeFi interest (income)
    - Gas costs (deductible)
```

### Step 11: Advanced Optimizations
```
11.1 Flash loan leveraging
    Build position without capital:
    
    a. Flash borrow 1000 ETH
    b. Stake to stETH
    c. Supply to Aave
    d. Borrow 700 ETH
    e. Repeat recursive loop
    f. End with 2,266 ETH debt
    g. Repay 1000 ETH flash loan
    h. Net position built with 0 upfront

11.2 MEV protection
    For large transactions:
    - Use Flashbots RPC
    - Set high priority fee
    - Bundle transactions
    - Use MEV-protected pools

11.3 Cross-protocol arbitrage
    Monitor for opportunities:
    - stETH/ETH discounts >0.5%
    - wstETH/stETH ratio inefficiencies  
    - Funding rate disparities
    - Borrow rate differences

11.4 Liquidity provision overlay
    Use excess collateral:
    - LP in Curve stETH/ETH
    - Earn trading fees + CRV
    - Maintain as reserve collateral
```

## Phase 6: Risk Management & Reporting

### Step 12: Risk Controls
```
12.1 Position limits
    Hard limits enforced:
    - Maximum leverage: 4x
    - Maximum position: $50M
    - Single venue exposure: <40%
    - Minimum health: 1.25

12.2 Circuit breakers
    Auto-trigger conditions:
    - stETH depeg >3%: FULL EXIT
    - Health factor <1.2: DELEVERAGE 50%
    - Funding >0.05% daily: CLOSE PERPS
    - Smart contract exploit: EMERGENCY EXIT

12.3 Backup procedures
    Failover systems:
    - Secondary RPC nodes
    - Backup perpetual venues
    - Alternative liquidation paths
    - Manual override capability

12.4 Insurance & hedging
    Protection layers:
    - Slashing insurance (if available)
    - Smart contract coverage
    - Maintain 10% cash reserve
    - Stop losses on perpetuals
```

### Step 13: Automated Reporting
```
13.1 Real-time dashboard
    Update every minute:
    - Current leverage ratio
    - Health factor with graph
    - P&L (realized + unrealized)
    - Funding rates all venues
