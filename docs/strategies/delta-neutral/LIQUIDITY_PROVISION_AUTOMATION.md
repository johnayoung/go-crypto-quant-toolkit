```

### Step 2: Yield Optimization Matrix
```
2.1 Fee generation projections
    Base case (medium volatility):
    - Daily volume: $500M ETH/USDC
    - Pool TVL: $200M
    - Your share: 0.5% ($1M position)
    - Fee tier: 0.3%
    - Capture rate: 40% (concentrated)
    - Daily fees: $600
    - Annual: $219,000 (21.9% APR)
    
    High volatility scenario:
    - Daily volume: $1B+
    - Capture rate: 50%
    - Daily fees: $1,500
    - Annual: $547,500 (54.7% APR)

2.2 Impermanent loss calculations
    Price movement scenarios:
    - ETH +50%: IL = -5.7%
    - ETH +100%: IL = -13.4%
    - ETH -50%: IL = -12.5%
    - ETH -67%: IL = -20%
    
    With concentrated liquidity:
    - Multiply IL by concentration factor
    - ±10% range: IL multiplied by ~5x
    - ±5% range: IL multiplied by ~10x
    - Need aggressive hedging

2.3 Options hedging costs
    Strategy components:
    - Buy ETH puts for downside protection
    - Buy ETH calls for upside protection
    - Or: Strangle strategy
    - Cost: 8-12% annually for full protection
    - Partial hedge: 4-6% annually
    
    Dynamic hedging:
    - Adjust with implied volatility
    - Increase during high volatility
    - Reduce during stable periods

2.4 Net return projections
    Conservative estimate:
    + LP fees (20% APR): 200 ETH
    + Trading rewards: 50 ETH
    + Negative funding capture: 20 ETH
    - Options hedging: -80 ETH
    - Gas costs: -20 ETH
    - Slippage/rebalancing: -10 ETH
    = Net return: 160 ETH (16% APY)
    
    Aggressive estimate:
    + LP fees (40% APR): 400 ETH
    + Rewards and incentives: 80 ETH
    - Hedging and costs: -120 ETH
    = Net return: 360 ETH (36% APY)
```

## Phase 2: Position Construction (One-Time Setup)

### Step 3: Liquidity Position Deployment
```

    - Range exit imminent
```

### Step 5: Perpetual Hedge Implementation
```
5.1 Calculate exact hedge size
    Delta neutrality requirement:
    - LP position: Variable delta
    - At range center: 500 ETH long
    - At range edges: 0 or 1000 ETH
    - Options delta: Variable with price
    - Target: Net zero delta

5.2 Distribute perpetual shorts
    Multi-venue approach:
    
    40% on GMX V2 (200 ETH):
    - Best funding usually
    - On-chain transparency
    - No liquidation below 10x
    
    30% on dYdX v4 (150 ETH):
    - Deep liquidity
    - Cross-margin
    - Low fees
    
    30% on Binance (150 ETH):
    - Ultimate liquidity
    - Lowest fees
    - API automation

5.3 Execute perpetual positions

    - Emergency rebalance at 50 ETH
    - Use cheapest venue first
    - Maintain hedge ratios

5.5 Funding optimization

    Volatility-based:
    - Vol spike >30%: Widen range
    - Vol drop >30%: Tighten range
    - Regime change: Full reset

6.3 Rebalancing execution
    Range adjustment process:
    
    a. Calculate new optimal range
    b. Prepare exit transaction
    c. Remove liquidity from old range

6.5 Multi-range strategies
    Split liquidity across ranges:
    - 50% in tight range (±2%)
    - 30% in medium range (±5%)
    - 20% in wide range (±10%)
    - Reduces rebalancing needs

## Economic Analysis

### Initial Capital Requirements
- LP deployment: 1000 ETH ($2M)
- Options collateral: 100 ETH
- Perpetual margin: 100 ETH
- Gas reserve: 20 ETH
- Emergency reserve: 50 ETH
- Total: 1270 ETH

### Monthly Operating Costs
- Gas fees: ~20 ETH
- Options premiums: ~80 ETH
- Funding (if positive): ~10 ETH
- Infrastructure: ~5 ETH
- Total: ~115 ETH

### Expected Returns (Base Case)
- LP fees: 300 ETH/year (30%)
- Trading rewards: 50 ETH/year
- Negative funding: 20 ETH/year
- Gross: 370 ETH/year
- Less costs: -140 ETH/year
- Net: 230 ETH/year (23% APY)

### Best Case Scenario
- High volatility environment
- LP fees: 500 ETH/year
- Rewards: 100 ETH/year
- Less costs: -150 ETH/year
- Net: 450 ETH/year (45% APY)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Range Management Excellence** - Must maintain >80% time in range
2. **Delta Discipline** - Never exceed ±50 ETH exposure
3. **Gas Optimization** - Execute during low-cost windows
4. **Options Efficiency** - Roll at optimal times, right-size protection
5. **Competition Awareness** - Adapt to changing LP landscape
6. **Risk Limits** - Strict adherence to stop-losses

## Emergency Procedures

### Range Breach Event
1. Immediate range expansion
2. Reduce position size
3. Adjust hedges
4. Document losses
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Volatility Explosion (>100% annualized)
1. Exit all narrow ranges
2. Deploy only wide ranges
3. Maximum options protection
4. Reduce to 50% capital deployed
5. Wait for stabilization

### Protocol Exploit
1. Exit all positions immediately
2. Use flashloans if needed
3. Accept any slippage
4. Move funds to secure wallet
5. Full audit before re-entry

### Liquidity Crisis
