### Step 2: Yield Optimization Matrix
```
2.1 Calculate Pendle fixed yields
    PT-stETH analysis example (Dec 2025 maturity):
    - Current PT price: 0.92 ETH
    - Maturity value: 1.0 ETH
    - Days to maturity: 365
    - Fixed yield: (1/0.92 - 1) * 365/365 = 8.7% APY
    - Plus underlying stETH yield: 3.5%
    - Total fixed return: 12.2% APY
    
    Optimal maturity selection:
    - Short-term (30-90 days): Lower yield, less risk
    - Medium-term (180-365 days): Balanced yield/risk
    - Long-term (365+ days): Higher yield, duration risk
    
2.2 Calculate leveraged returns
    Starting with 1000 ETH capital:
    
    Pendle LP position (1000 ETH):
    - Supply to PT-stETH/SY-stETH pool
    - Fixed yield: 8.7% on PT side
    - Variable yield: 3.5% on SY side
    - LP fees: 0.3% of volume
    - PENDLE rewards: 4.2% APY
    - Base position return: ~16.7% APY
    
    Leverage addition (50% LTV):
    - Borrow 500 ETH against position
    - Deploy to GMX GLP
    - ETH rewards from fees: 15-25% APY
    - esGMX rewards: 10-15% APY
    - Multiplier points: 100% APR on staked
    
2.3 Net position calculations
    Revenue streams:
    + Pendle fixed yield: 87 ETH/year
    + Pendle LP fees: 3 ETH/year
    + PENDLE rewards: 42 ETH value/year
    + GMX ETH distribution: 100 ETH/year
    + esGMX value: 60 ETH equivalent/year
    
    Costs:
    - Borrow cost (3%): -15 ETH/year
    - Funding (if positive): Variable
    - Gas and operations: -5 ETH/year
    
    Net return: ~272 ETH/year (27.2% APY)
    
2.4 Risk-adjusted scoring
    Position ranking factors:

    7 days before:
    - Start unwinding position
    - Move to next maturity
    - Maintain continuous exposure

10.2 GLP rebalancing response
    When index weights change:
    
    If ETH weight increases:
    - Need more perpetual shorts
    - Calculate additional size
    - Execute across venues
    
    If ETH weight decreases:
    - Reduce perpetual shorts
    - Free up collateral
    - Maintain delta neutrality

10.3 Leverage adjustments

    d. Increase perpetual hedge by 30 ETH
    e. Verify health factor >1.5
    
    Decreasing leverage:
    
    a. Sell portion of GLP
    b. Receive ETH back
    c. Repay borrowed amount
    d. Reduce perpetual positions
    e. Confirm improved health

10.4 Emergency deleveraging
    If critical event detected:
    
    Priority order:
    1. Close all perpetual shorts
    2. Exit GLP position to ETH
    3. Repay all borrowed ETH
    4. Unwind Pendle LP position
    5. Convert PT to underlying
    6. Exit to ETH or stables

## Economic Analysis

### Setup Costs
- Initial gas: ~$1,000
- Position building: ~$500
- Perpetual setup: ~$300
- Total one-time: ~$1,800

### Ongoing Costs (Monthly)
- Monitoring gas: ~$200
- Rebalancing: ~$500
- Claims: ~$300
- Emergency reserves: ~$200
- Total monthly: ~$1,200

### Expected Returns
- Gross APY: ~35% in ETH terms
- Net APY: ~32% after costs
- ETH return: 320 ETH/year on 1000 ETH
- USD value: ~$640k at $2000 ETH
- Break-even: <1 week

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Maintain PT Liquidity** - Must be able to exit Pendle position quickly
2. **Monitor GLP Composition** - ETH weight changes affect delta
3. **Track All Funding** - Multiple perpetual venues need coordination
4. **Health Factor >1.5** - Never compromise safety for yield
5. **Compound Weekly** - Maximize compounding effect
6. **Have Exit Plan** - Full unwind possible in <15 minutes

## Emergency Procedures

### PT Liquidity Crisis
1. Stop new positions immediately
2. Use YT market for exit if needed
3. Accept slippage to exit
4. Repay all debts
5. Document losses

### GLP Depeg Event
1. Exit GLP immediately
2. Accept exit fees
3. Adjust perpetual hedge
4. Move to alternative venue
5. Wait for stability

### Smart Contract Risk
1. Monitor all protocols continuously
2. Exit affected protocol immediately
3. Use flashloans if needed
4. Accept any slippage
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Market Crash Scenario
1. Auto-deleverage at preset levels
2. Close perpetuals first
3. Exit GLP if needed
4. Maintain core PT position
5. Wait for recovery
