## Implementation Sequence

### Commit 1: Project Setup & Core Primitives

**Goal**: Establish Go module and type-safe financial primitives used across all layers

**Depends**: none

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Initialize Go module with `go.mod` and `go.sum`
- [x] Add `github.com/shopspring/decimal` dependency
- [x] Create `primitives/types.go` with Price, Amount, Decimal wrapper types
- [x] Create `primitives/time.go` with Time and Duration types
- [x] Implement type-safe arithmetic preventing invalid operations (e.g., Price + Amount = compile error)
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for all primitive types in `primitives/primitives_test.go`
- [x] Create `.golangci.yml` configuration file for linting standards
- [x] Create basic `README.md` with project vision and extensibility focus
- [x] Add `LICENSE` file

**Success**:

---

### Commit 2: Mechanism Interface Definitions

**Goal**: Define extensible interface contracts for all market mechanism categories

**Depends**: Commit 1 (primitives for method signatures)

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Create `mechanisms/mechanism.go` with base `MarketMechanism` interface
- [x] Create `mechanisms/liquidity_pool.go` with `LiquidityPool` interface (Calculate, AddLiquidity, RemoveLiquidity methods)

- [x] Create `mechanisms/orderbook.go` with `OrderBook` interface (BestBid, BestAsk, PlaceOrder, CancelOrder methods)
- [x] Define supporting types: `PoolParams`, `PoolState`, `TokenAmounts`, `PriceParams`, `Greeks`, `Order`, `OrderID`
- [x] Create `mechanisms/mechanisms_test.go` with property-based test framework for interface contract validation (actual tests added when implementations exist)
- [x] Document interface contracts with godoc comments including expected behaviors and error conditions

**Success**:
- ✅ All interface methods have clear godoc comments describing contracts
- ✅ Supporting types use primitives (Price, Amount, Decimal) consistently

- [x] Create `strategy/action.go` with `Action` interface for portfolio modifications
- [x] Create `strategy/market.go` with `MarketSnapshot` abstraction for market data
- [x] Implement concrete action types: `AddPositionAction`, `RemovePositionAction`, `ReplacePositionAction`, `AdjustCashAction`, `BatchAction`
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests in `strategy/strategy_test.go` covering portfolio operations
- [x] Document thread-safety guarantees and error handling patterns

**Success**:

- ✅ Portfolio is mechanism-agnostic (works with any Position implementation)
- ✅ Thread-safety documented: Portfolio safe for concurrent reads, requires external sync for concurrent writes
- ✅ Cash management supports negative balances (leverage/debt) using Decimal internally

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Interface Stability**: Once Commit 2 is complete, mechanism interfaces should not change (add new interfaces, don't modify existing)
2. **Zero Framework Coupling**: Commits 4-5 must not require changes to Commits 1-3 code (validates extensibility)
3. **Decimal Precision**: All financial calculations use `primitives.Decimal` wrappers (no float64 for money)
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage for core packages (primitives, mechanisms, strategy, backtest)
5. **Working System**: Each commit produces buildable, testable code (no "wire it up later" commits)
6. **Community Readiness**: Commit 8 documentation must enable external developers to contribute mechanisms
